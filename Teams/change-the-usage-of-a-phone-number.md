# Change the usage of a phone number

Sometimes there is a need to change the usage of a phone number after it was acquired or ported in.

To change the usage of a phone number by using the Teams admin center:

1.  Open the Microsoft Teams admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin or a Teams administrator. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.

2.  In the left navigation, click **Voice** \> **Phone numbers**.

3.  On the **Phone numbers** page, select an unassigned number in the list, and then click **Change usage**. 

      > [!NOTE]
      > Make sure you are selecting an **unassigned** number before trying to change the usage of it, otherwise the option will not be visible. If the number is currently assigned, you need to [remove the phone number from a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user#remove-a-phone-number-from-a-user) or resource account first.

4.  In the **Change usage** pane, open the list of Available usages for the phone number, and then click on the desired option to select it.        

      > [!NOTE]
      > The list will only display usages available for the telephone number, depending on its number type (geographic or nongeographic, or toll-free) and supplier. You can quickly review the available usages for each phone number by setting visible the **Available usages** column in the Phone numbers table.

5.  Click **Apply** to set the Licensed usage.
